Appclusive provides an open REST API based on the [OData](http://odata.org) standard which you can use to interact with it. You can use your favourite HTTP client (such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) to perform your tasks.

In addition to this API, Appclusive also provides several language specific clients:

* [C# .NET](CSharpDotNet/)
* [PowerShell](PowerShell/)
