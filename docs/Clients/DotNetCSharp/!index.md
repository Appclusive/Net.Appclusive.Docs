# .Net C# Client

Appclusive (R) provides a .Net C# assembly which you can use to manage and work with the Appclusive API. This module interacts with the basic Appclusive Odatav3 API. For more information about the API  see the documentation [.Net C# client](../Endpoints/Api).

If you prefer to work with a higher-level client, have a look at the [PowerShell Client](../PowerShell/!index).
