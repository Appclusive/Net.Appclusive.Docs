Appclusive (R) provides a .NET assembly (written in C#) which you can use to manage and work with the Appclusive API. This module interacts with the basic Appclusive OData v3 API. For more information about the API refer to the [accompanying documentation](../Endpoints/Api).

If you prefer to work with a higher-level client, have a look at the [PowerShell Client](PowerShell).

# Installation

You can use [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) and run [`install-package Net.Appclusive.Net.Client`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Net.Appclusive.Net.Client/) to install the assembly into your project.
